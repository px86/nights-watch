#+TITLE: Night's Watch - watch files for modifications
#+AUTHOR: Pushkar Raj

* About

=nwatch= accepts file names and a command. It repeatedly checks the files for modifications and re-executes the given command.

* Compilation

#+begin_src shell
  make
#+end_src

* Usage

For example, let's say that you have two files named, =index.html= and =style.css=, and you want to restart the web server, every-time you modify any of the files.

#+begin_src shell
  nwatch index.html css/style.css -- python3 -m http.server
#+end_src

* Notes

- Works only on UNIX like platforms.

- Currently the given command is launched using =exec= calls, so do not expect =shell= like behavior, e.g. =&= and file globing etc. However, it may be supported in the near future.
